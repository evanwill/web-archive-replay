*This is a demo proof of concept project!*

The web-archive-replay template uses [ReplayWeb.page embedding](https://replayweb.page/docs/embedding) to provide access to a web archive file (WACZ or WARC format) in a completely self-contained static web project.
All necessary dependencies are included in the template so that you do not have to rely on 3rd party CDNs or APIs.
This allows you to sustainably publish a curated web archive along side contextual information as a digital exhibit website.

The basic steps for using the template are: 

1. create repository from the template
2. edit _config.yml
3. edit content pages
4. add web archive to a page

See [docs/setup-web-archive.md](https://github.com/evanwill/web-archive-replay/blob/main/docs/setup-web-archive.md) for details.
The template builds on [bootstrap5-template](https://github.com/thecdil/bootstrap5-template)--see "docs/create-website.md" for details on setting up and customizing the basic website.
