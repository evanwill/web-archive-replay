# web-archive-replay

*This is a demo proof of concept project!*

[web-archive-replay](https://github.com/evanwill/web-archive-replay) is a basic template repository to create a self-contained site providing access to web archive captures, using Jekyll on GitHub Pages (or where every you want to host it), powered by [ReplayWeb.page](https://replayweb.page/docs/embedding).
This allows you to sustainably publish a curated web archive along side contextual information as a stand alone digital exhibit website.

Demo: <https://evanwill.github.io/web-archive-replay/>

See also [web-replay-gen](https://github.com/webrecorder/web-replay-gen), an Eleventy project template from the Webrecorder team with a similar aim.

## Get Started 

See ["docs/setup-web-archive.md"](https://github.com/evanwill/web-archive-replay/blob/main/docs/setup-web-archive.md) for details of how to set up the web archive access. 

Basic site set up:

- Click green "Use this template" button to make a copy of the code in your own repository (alternatively, use Import or manually copy files)
- Edit `_config.yml` with your site information
- In your new repository visit "Settings" > "Pages" to activate GitHub Pages
- Edit and create pages in the "pages" folder (probably in Markdown). Use each page's yaml front matter to populate the navbar:
    - `title` will appear as h1 at top of the page content.
    - `nav` if this option has a value, it will appear in the navbar as link to this page.
    - `nav_order` navbar items will be sorted using this number. 
- Use "includes" to simplify adding Bootstrap features to Markdown pages (see comments in the "_include/" files for instructions).

See [docs/create-website.md](https://github.com/thecdil/bootstrap5-template/blob/main/docs/create-website.md) for more details.
